# WEEK-1-CHALLENGE

## Description


This is my first week's challenge as part of the UNC Chapel-Hill Coding Bootcamp. A big first step in my new professional development.
I built this site to show my progess made based on taught material to my instructors as well as myself.
This challenge was to incorporate semantics and more user accessibility to this mock site as well as future projects.
Various semantics elements and their purpose.
